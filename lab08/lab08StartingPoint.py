# removeSilentE is an example of a "heuristic".  A heuristic is an approach to

#    (1) Let "howMany" be the number of 'a's in the word after it has been
#        processed by the syllableHelper function.

#  'e' from these words.  The rule also works for 'be', 'we', 'the', where the final e should
#  NOT be removed.  Some words where this rule fails are  "castle", "chronicle", "muscle"
#  The idea of a heuristic is that exceptions like these
#  are rare, so the rule is still pretty good.    Problem solving is often a matter of

# countSyllables is a final example of a heuristic
# The theory is that the number of vowels in a word is a good indicator of the number of syllables
# in the word, if we (a) remove silent e, (b) remove final ed when it doesn't create a new syllable
# and (c) remove duplicate consecutive vowels in words like "boat", "patient", "pursuit" and "gaucho"

# this sentence.  Then, try it on the first paragraph or two of the declaration of independence,

#   "alien", "likely", "States".
